## Discussion Items
| Item | Who | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| SOGNO Releases      | All     | Too many sub projects to describe, need to define releases in some nice way. Want to create general API's (e.g. Load Forecasting) and then document this via ReDoc. Aim for two releases per year (for example the Ubuntu xx.04 and xx.10 release cycle every 6 months).   Should have all example deployments in line with a release. Dependencies are automatically validated via LFX. |
