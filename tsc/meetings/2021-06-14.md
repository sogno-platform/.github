## Discussion Items
| Item | Who | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Organisation     | All | Current zoom link should work until the end of the year     |
| Arch Figure     | All  | Newer more detailed architecture diagram has been added to the [overview](https://sogno-platform.github.io/docs/overview), it is also interactive and will take users to the services repos on GitHub     |
| ProLoaF      | All  | New load forecasting service has been added to the repo on GitHub, [ProLoaF](https://github.com/sogno-platform/proloaf)    |
| RWTH PMU Demo    | RWTH  | [Demo has been setup in RWTH with live data](https://sogno-pmus.k8s.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de), which will aim to run continously and be publicly available, architecture will the SOGNO model. Further work planned to bring all components into Kubernetes.     |
| Kafka/Strimzi     | RWTH  | Support for MQTT/AMPQ Kafka/Strimzi is being added currently, work will continue on this. VILLAS/DPsim support for Kafka is available      |
| Reverse Proxy  | RWTH, WIT | Work on this is continuing, Live demo is using nginx reverse proxy ingress controller.  |
| API frontend | All | New version to replace deprecated Python package as it was deprecated. New project added, [dpsim-api](https://github.com/sogno-platform/dpsim-api) REST api written in Rust.    |
| Integration Efforts | All | Integration with FLEDGE through kafka. ProLoaF and Alliander forecasting tool. Simulation tools - DPsim and PowSyBl. OperatorFabric as GUI with Message Broker in between. Will discuss in more detail at the next TSC. |
| AOB | All | Some services from original SOGNO project is not in place, such as Power Quality and FLISR. Should we plan to add these at a later date? Power Quality would be relatively easy to add, FLISR would require more work as some customised algorithms were used to suit the trials, these would need to be generalised before being integrated into LFE SOGNO.   |
