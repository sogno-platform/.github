## Discussion Items
| Item | Who | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| SOGNO Releases      | All     | Questions about navigation, what do we want users to see? How do we share the project and github pages? SEO, Linkedin? Markus will ask LFE members about this.  |
| Deployment      | All     | SOGNO has been used in Platone, in a workpackage in another project, SOGNO services (PMU data visualisation) being used to store and visualise data aggregations. They are using AKS and have some specific requirements for configuration which is providing useful learnings to bring back to SOGNO platform deployments.     |
| Kafka     | All     | LFE SOGNO requires implementation of Kafka integration. Will contact FLEDGE project for input on this item. Currently investigating Kafka streams and custom Kafka
connector. There should be a prototype ready in the next couple weeks. Omicron, Alliander, RTE.     |
| Reverse Proxy     | All      | Reverse proxy implementation in Platone project, to allow user to feel they are using one API altough referencing seperate services. Some limitations of Kubernetes in this case, if wanting to use managed auth services may require reconfiguration of Kubernetes ingress controller as auth config would be static in here. Within Azure environment, this is not possible. Considering adding another reverse proxy behind ingress and would be responsible for polling seperate identify management service. Could also control access to particular services based on identity.      |
